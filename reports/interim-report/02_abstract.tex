With the advent of technology, the demand of energy has also increased dramatically. Increasing number of electric driven equipmentâ€™s such as personal devices, hybrid vehicles and embedded systems has made energy management crucial. To help manage the dynamic energy consumption by the systems. This project deals and tries to analyse the dependence of some low-level events with the energy consumption by finding the existence of functional relationship between them. Our project detects the functional dependence rather than recognising the form of dependence. This acts as a form of test to determine the nonexistence of a solution to prevent the unneeded search.
