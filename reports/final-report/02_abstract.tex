With the advent of technology, the demand of energy has increased dramatically. Increasing number of electrically driven equipment such as personal devices, hybrid vehicles and embedded systems have made the management of energy crucial. This projectâ€™s focus is on understanding the energy consumption by High-Performance Computers. It has been known that CPU power consumption correlates to processor performance. And a number of models have been proposed to use performance events e.g. cache miss, DMA access, I/O interrupt, for the estimation of power consumption by the systems. This project takes a novel approach.Instead of estimating the energy consumption by the systems using performance events, a software is developed in order to better understand the functional relationship between the performance events and the energy consumption. A number of linear models were proposed due to the trickle-down effect of the performance events on power consumption\cite{gilberto2005power}. The software also tries to analyze the linear dependence between the performance events and the energy consumption. This analysis helps validate the linear models that have already been proposed.
