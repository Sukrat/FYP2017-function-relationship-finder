With the advent of technology, the demand of energy has also increased dramatically. Increasing number of electric driven equipmentâ€™s such as personal devices, hybrid vehicles and embedded systems has made energy management crucial. To help manage the dynamic energy consumption by the systems. This project attempts to create a software that tries to analyse the dependence of some low-level events with the energy consumption by finding the existence of functional relationship between them. Our project detects and analysis the functional dependence rather than recognising the exact form of dependence. This acts as a form of test to determine the nonexistence of a solution to prevent the unneeded search. It also tries to understand the behaviour and contribution of various parameters towards the output. To understand the behaviour linearity between input parameters and output is assumed.
